# Guess-it-2
* `ayessenb` 


## Algorithms project in go lang testing period

I created the program which receives a data from server. 

* go.mod - defines a module, which is a collection of Go packages. It contains the data about the module, such as its name, version, and dependencies on other modules. (not using extra packages)
* go.sum - contain a list of all the downloaded modules, their versions, and their hash.
* main.go - guess it 1 main function that scans the valus and adds to the slice which will be used for finding the range (with min and max values)
#### Functions:


* Linear Regression
* Pearson Correlation Coefficient


#### Improved skills:
* go lang programming skills 
* usage of math, strconv, sort libraries of Go
* running the server
* Scanner of the Go lang

## Audit 
1. Download [this zip file](https://assets.01-edu.org/guess-it/guess-it.zip) and move the `student/` folder into guess-it. The filesystem should look somethings like this:

```console
─ guess-it/
├── ai/
│   ├── big-range
│   └── ...4
    └── script.sh

```
2. Go to the `guess-it` folder and run this command:
```
chmod +x *
```
3. Run the following commands:
```
npm install
node server.js
```
4. Open your browser in the port [3000](http://localhost:3000/)
5. Add a guesser. You just need to add in the url the guesser in other words, the name of one of the files present in the `ai/` folder.
For example:

```
?guesser=big-range
```
